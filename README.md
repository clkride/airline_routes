# Project Description
In this project, I have tried to explore the domestic and international airline traffic using OpenFlights Database. Using SQL queries, I have identified the following:

* Busiest Airports based on number of flights
* Most popular Routes by number of flights
* Domestic Connectivity for each country
* Longest Routes
* Airlines Market Share by number of flights
* Important Airports Connecting Busiest Routes 


# Data Set Description
Airports, Airline, Route, Plane, and Country
(Link: https://openflights.org/data.html#schedule)

The OpenFlights/Airline Route Mapper Route Database contains 
67663 routes between 3321 airports on 548 airlines spanning the globe.

# Business Benefits
Airports and Airline Companies around the world can use this interactive dashboard to â€“ 

* Find shortest routes between source and destination airports, 
* Forecast flight delays by integrating weather forecast data
* Estimate capacity requirements at connecting airports to handle incoming or redirected flight traffic, 
* Identify choke points in this complex interwoven network by identifying weak links to prevent meltdown at airports
